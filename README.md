# Term-Project
My term project for OIM3640

Group Members: Caitlin Mary Caron

### **The Big Idea** 
The main idea of my project is to make make a movie recommendation generator in python. I am hoping to explore more about APIs and other tools in python. My MVP would be a generator that can recommend movies based on genre, but my stretch goal is to have it recommend movies based off of another movie.  

### **Learning Objectives**
I want to be able to learn about a new concept that hasn't been covered in our class so far, showing that I have the initiative to take the time to work through something new while making something that I find interesting. I want to also make sure to stick to my implementation plan/project schedule so that I stay on track, and can avoid asking for last minute help. Another learning objective is to try things on my own before utilizing help from the internet, rather than go to it right away. I also want to learn more about styling. 

### **Implementation Plans**
I am not completely sure about how I will go about implementing my project, but I am going to try and give myself a good amount of time to figure out what I want to include, and what concepts I need to learn about before utilizing the library/framework in my project. I might test things out with a few examples to make sure that I understand what I'm doing, and what the results are supposed to look like. I'll also try to see how others might have done something similar to gain insight. 

### **Project Schedule**
Week 1/2ish: explore frameworks/libraries that will be most beneficial for me to work with, start exploring what resources might be helpful for me to use, also decide what content I want to include in the project
Week 3: Begin implenting frameworks/libraries, executing project blueprint 
Week 4: troubleshoot, evaluate the process thus far, meet with professor, continue to work on project
Week 5/6: continue to work on project, take time to test different methods, apply styling, unique features, etc.

### **Collaboration Plan**
I will be working by myself on this project, and will do my best to stay on track with my previous project schedule. I am not sure if I am using any software development methodologies, but will clarify in the future if I do. 

### **Risks and Limitations**
I think the most significant threat to this project's success is not staying on track with my project schedule. I am in my final semester at Babson, and am experiencing senioritis like a number of other classmates. I want to make sure that I stay on track so that this project will be something that I am proud of. 

### **Additional Course Content**
I'm not sure what topics will be beneficial thus far, but I imagine that what we've learned about app creation and APIs will be beneficial!
